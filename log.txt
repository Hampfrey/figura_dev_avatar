 g: want to work on another major feature i've been wanting to add just because i can
    going add a "blood system", by measuring the player's health i want to apply various blood overlays to the model to correspond with damage
    ie, if you're slightly hurt you might have some minor damage, some dirt around the legs, etc, but if you're half a heart you'll be soaked in red

    also just remembered, won't do it now but need to update the f6 help docs

 r: blood system finished, worked surprisingly well
    added functions to merged two textures together into one, could be very useful in future projects
