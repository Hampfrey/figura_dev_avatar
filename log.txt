ENTRIES

 g: begin the foundations of the project

 r: some basic elements started, by manually directing which component to edit, its position and rotation can be crudely changed
    need to add "local axis rotation," currently the rotation controls become very confusing as they stack up in multiple directions

25/02/09
 g: update the dress to to work in more situations and to have more accurate movement

 r: dress now leans back and forth based on the difference between the body facing vector and the movement vector
    dress walk cycle is now scaled based on speed
    dress can now sit
    dress code was moved from personal desktop to laptop and GitHub

 l: need to get GitHub working on personal desktop

25/02/21
 g: no clue, haven't updated log in 12 days, still working on local rotation

 r: moving towards finishing the rest of the program, then figuring out the local math

25/02/25
 g: reorganize the new action wheels and infrastructure for the pose editor

 r: action wheel has custom icons
    second page for other
    seems mostly working

25/02/26
 g: update to figura v0.1.5

25/02/27
 g: make project sync with figura backend

 r: maybe made to sync? cannot test without second instance

 l: want to add a hud for the system, currently struggling to get it to show

25/02/28
 g: want to work on another major feature i've been wanting to add just because i can
    going add a "blood system", by measuring the player's health i want to apply various blood overlays to the model to correspond with damage
    ie, if you're slightly hurt you might have some minor damage, some dirt around the legs, etc, but if you're half a heart you'll be soaked in red

    also just remembered, won't do it now but need to update the f6 help docs

 r: blood system finished, worked surprisingly well
    added functions to merged two textures together into one, could be very useful in future projects

FUTURE GOALS AS DETERMINED IN THE SHOWER

Config
- restructure generally -- one empty slot
- blink use scroll to set between "auto", "eyes open", and "eyes closed"
- blood also use scroll, "auto", "none", "lvl 1", "lvl 2", "lvl 3"

PE
- save load
- config menu internally
> specialized avatar for screenshots, removing certain features and allowing for multiple avatars to be posed at once
- add hud

Other
- improve blink
- figure out what to do with that empty config slot
> more emotes
x add 4px arm compat
- independent eye control.
> update f6 help doc
x camera control
> test if armor works

Fixes
> fix current emotes for dress
- revert accidental sleeping removal
- fix that dress rotation bug
- fix what happens when blink stacks with animations that use it
- consider why arrows turned into pe hud assets once

25/03/02
 g: blink and blood config settings

 r: done

 l: make sure working between clients

25/03/03
 g: add PE export and load using the clipboard
 
 r: that's done

25/03/03
 g: github?

 r: working!

25/03/03
 r: fresh coat of paint for pe, alongside error correction
    pe load can now prevent false data, data oversize, data undersize, and wrong data errors
    pe text descriptors now have special formatting and color

25/03/05
 g: do some fixes

 r: fixed dress rot when pe active and inactive
    fixed blink being weird using animation priority
    added independent eye control

 l: monitor eye control for bugs
    update secondary face blink to match

25/03/05
 g: add hud to PE

 r: hud added

25/03/07
 g: make hud do more things

 r: hud now highlights currently pressed buttons

to improve the ease of editing the blood textures for more specialized skins, and because of just how the blood textures are designed to work, the "outer layer" of the skin is identical to the main layer, previously, i had to tediously copy and paste parts of the textures to get the outer layer matched, this can be done automatically and the pseudo code is shown below

PESUDO CODE FOR BLOOD TEXTURE GEN
    function generate_blood_layers(blood_texture) then
        -- do match texture for 
              body, main arm and leg block,	( 0, 16) (53, 31) c ( 0, 32)
              head block, 			( 0,  0) (31, 15) c (32,  0)
              secondary leg block, 		(16, 48) (31, 63) c ( 0, 48)
              secondary arm block, 		(32, 48) (47, 63) c (48, 48)
              face to blink, 			( 8,  8) (15, 15) c ( 0,  0)
              face to secondary, 		( 8,  8) (15, 15) c (24,  0) 
              face to secondary blink, 		( 8,  8) (15, 15) c (32,  0)
              chest block			(56, 16) (63, 23) c (56, 24)
              dress block			( 0,  0) (27, 20) c ( 0, 21)
        match_texture_sections(blood_texture, b1 vec2, b2 vec2, c1 vec2, c2 vec2)
        -- no return, is editing the given texture
    end

    function match_texture_sections(texture, b1 vec2, b2 vec2, c vec2)
         -- texture is the texture to modify, it will match to itself
         -- b1 and b2 are vector 2s corresponding to the base area
         -- c is the vec 2 to cast the base area to
         for region_y do -- region_y starts at b1.y, and goes to b2.y
             for region_x do -- region_x starts at b1.x, and goes to b2.x
                 GET BASE PIXEL
                 subtract current x by b1.x and current y by b1.y to zero the location
                 add c to the zeroed location to get the pixel to cast to
                 CAST
             end
         end
         -- no return, is editing the given texture

 g: do the above

 r: above did

 l: want to figure out what to do for the camera control.

25/03/13
 g: misc fixes, re-add sleeping, add PE to the config menu

 r: sleeping simplified and working
    pe in config menu with a nice icon
